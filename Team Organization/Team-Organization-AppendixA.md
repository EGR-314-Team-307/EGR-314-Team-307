### Communication Procedures

We have a Discord server set up for daily communication. If there isn't a response or we need a rapid response, we would text or call them. If they are completely unresponsive, we would email them as a last resort before bringing it to the professor.

## Meeting Schedule

When possible, class time will be used as the primary weekly meetings. Subsequent meetings and their modality will be determined by necessity, however, the following times have been identified as when the majority of team members will be available:

- Tuesday - 1pm-6pm
- Wednesday - 2pm-5pm
- Thursday - 2pm-6pm

### Meeting Coordination

We will discuss during class whether or not we need to meet in person or through Discord for the week. If we need to edit the meeting hours, we will reference the meeting schedule highlighted above and make necessary adjustments. The preferred format of meetings is virtual, but when necessary, we will meet in the Peralta lab in person.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Table 2: Project Roles and Duties

| Role            | Duties                                                                                                           |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Meeting leader  | Schedules team meetings, runs each meeting, turns in assignments                                                  |
| Meeting recorder| Takes minutes of each team meeting, including attendance, and records action items and to whom they are assigned   |
| Assignment leader | Coordinates the team's work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date                                  |
| Project monitor | Tracks the team's progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status |

#### Specifications:
- Roles will change every three assignments
- Roles will rotate in order, beginning with each member choosing their role
- If a team member is falling behind in their responsibilities, provided other members are up to date on their work, they can help out the team member who is struggling
- If the three other team members feel one person isn't a good fit for a role, they can let the person know and the team member can be assigned a different role.
- Team activities and milestones will be tracked via Canvas submissions and in-person progress checkpoints
- Team members will be assigned technical responsibilities based on their talents and comfortability in different fields

## Team Coordination & Accountability

- In team meetings, the leader will talk about upcoming deadlines, and we'll figure out when and how to finish each task.
- Once three team members agree, an assignment is good to submit.
- If someone gets feedback on a design, they can share it on Discord. Then, we can all talk about what to do next.
- If a team member isn't doing well, we'll help them with extra meetings and study sessions.
- If someone stops trying, we might have to issue a pink slip.

## Conflict Recognition & Resolution

As a team, we promise to talk openly when conflicts come up. We'll listen to everyone's worries and work together to find solutions. We aim to fix things in a way that helps the team and keeps our work atmosphere positive.
