# Design Ideation
During the design ideation phase, the team created a Jamboard and proceeded to put up any idea that came to mind, be it a phrase that sparked a thought, or an explicit statement saying what the idea was. No thought was dismissed outright, no matter how outlandish it may have seemed. Due to the space available on Jamboard, as well as the readability of the sticky note function, the ideas had to be boiled down to a handful of words. This helped the ideas stay at a vague enough level that each team member could use them as inspiration and go their own ways with it. The downside to this method was that some ideas sounded like rephrasings of others, so some discussion had to happen in order to justify keeping all or some of similar ideas. 
## Generate Ideas

### Sort Ideas
After the ideas were gathered, they were then sorted into project ideas and features. The team also identified prior to starting this that a focus on plant cultivation or care was an ideal concept based on the project scenario, so a third category was added to collect the ideas and features.

#### Design 1: Plant Frost Shield

During the winter, plant owners cover their plants to protect them from the freezing temperatures. Our design concept supports the health of a plant during extreme cold conditions by automatically covering the plants when it's too cold, based on readings of moisture and temperature. The sides of the design will be covered as well and are not covered for modeling purposes.

#### Design 2: Automated Plant Watering System

This automated plant watering system would use a timing system, moisture and temperature sensors, and two motors to manage the watering needs of a user’s shelf of plants. The sensor data would be used to determine the best times for watering, so the user can get feedback about the efficacy of whatever time intervals they use. The sensor information and watering status would be transmitted via WiFi to the user’s device so they can monitor it remotely. The watering head would move on rails back and forth so it can water the plants, then move out of the way so the user doesn’t obscure their plants. The system would include an emergency stop, both a manual one and an automated one, to avoid dumping the user’s entire water supply into the plants.

#### Design 3: Water Sensor Management Network

The Water Sensor Management Network is an advanced and comprehensive system designed to monitor and manage the percentage of water in the soil and the water quality across various environments. Using moisture sensor technologies and interconnected data infrastructure, this network provides real-time insights into water conditions, ensuring efficient resource management and environmental sustainability.
