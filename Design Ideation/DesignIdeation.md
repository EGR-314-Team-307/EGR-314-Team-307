#### Design 1: Plant Frost Shield

During the winter, plant owners cover their plants to protect them from the freezing temperatures. Our design concept supports the health of a plant during extreme cold conditions by automatically covering the plants when it's too cold, based on readings of moisture and temperature. The sides of the design will be covered as well and are not covered for modeling purposes.

#### Design 2: Automated Plant Watering System

This automated plant watering system would use a timing system, moisture and temperature sensors, and two motors to manage the watering needs of a user’s shelf of plants. The sensor data would be used to determine the best times for watering, so the user can get feedback about the efficacy of whatever time intervals they use. The sensor information and watering status would be transmitted via WiFi to the user’s device so they can monitor it remotely. The watering head would move on rails back and forth so it can water the plants, then move out of the way so the user doesn’t obscure their plants. The system would include an emergency stop, both a manual one and an automated one, to avoid dumping the user’s entire water supply into the plants.

#### Design 3: Water Sensor Management Network

The Water Sensor Management Network is an advanced and comprehensive system designed to monitor and manage the percentage of water in the soil and the water quality across various environments. Using moisture sensor technologies and interconnected data infrastructure, this network provides real-time insights into water conditions, ensuring efficient resource management and environmental sustainability.
