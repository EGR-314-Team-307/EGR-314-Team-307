# Hardware Proposal
With the selected microcontroller and components, the team put together a wiring schematic for each subsystem, taking into account any supplementary circuitry needed. The microcontroller required a switching voltage regulator that could take a 9V source and output a regulated 3.3V. This would also supply power to the subsystems. With the light and heat sensors, the team believes that is enough to determine the location of a simulated fire, as well as the motor being capable of rotating a simple actuator to aim a fire extinguisher towards that fire. The following image is the current circuit schematic of each subsystem.

The green portion of the PCB is the top view of the board, and the yellow portion shows the bottom. If this project were to continue, we would develop a new PCB that fixes the multiple problems we faced while integrating the different subsystems. We would first choose larger components to make soldering faster and less difficult. Another change we would implement would be to change the voltage regulator circuit to add a fuse and a switch to easily power on/off the device as well as add extra safety precautions. The team would also change the power supply from a battery to a wall plugin. This would enhance the device's autonomy by removing the need to replace or recharge the battery.
