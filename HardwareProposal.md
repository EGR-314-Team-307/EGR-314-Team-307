# Hardware Proposal

With the selected microcontroller and components, the team put together a wiring schematic for each subsystem, taking into account any supplementary circuitry needed. The microcontroller required a switching voltage regulator that could take a 9V source and output a regulated 3.3V. This would also supply power to the subsystems. With the light and heat sensors, the team believes that is enough to determine the location of a simulated fire, as well as the motor being capable of rotating a simple actuator to aim a fire extinguisher towards that fire. The following image is the current circuit schematic of each subsystem.
