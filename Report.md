# Team Organization Charter
When our team formed, we joined together to decide what the goals of this project would entail. From our discussion, we highlighted certain aspects that we deemed important to accomplish within the scope of the class. These ideals include:

- Demonstrate proficiency in core engineering principles
- Enhance leadership skills within our team
- Become proficient in understanding user needs
- Gain practical experience in embedded systems
- Develop team problem-solving skills and open communication


After brainstorming our shared expectations for the project, we summarized our collective thoughts into a product mission statement that encapsulates what we hope to achieve with this venture:

To create a usable, viable product that is relatively unique and allows a measure of automation to be brought to the crop growing process. As well as providing an appropriate level of challenge for each team member, and meeting the EGR 314 course requirements.

## Communication Channels
**Table 1: Team Member Communication Modes**

## Communication Procedures
We have a discord server set up for daily communication. If there isn't a response or we need a rapid response we would text or call them. If they are completely unresponsive we would email them as a last resort before bringing it to the professor.
## Meeting Schedule
When possible, class time will be used as the primary weekly meetings. Subsequent meetings and their modality will be determined by necessity, however the following times have been identified as when the majority of team members will be available:
- Tuesday - 1pm-6pm
- Wednesday - 2pm-5pm
- Thursday - 2pm-6pm
## Meeting Coordination
- We will discuss during class whether or not we need to meet in person or through Discord for the week. 
- If we need to edit the meeting hours, we will reference the meeting schedule highlighted above and make necessary adjustments.
- The preferred format of meetings is virtual, but when necessary, we will meet in the Peralta lab in person.
