Team Organization Charter

When our team formed, we joined together to decide what the goals of this project would entail. From our discussion, we highlighted certain aspects that we deemed important to accomplish within the scope of the class. These ideals include:

Demonstrate proficiency in core engineering principles
Enhance leadership skills within our team
Become proficient in understanding user needs
Gain practical experience in embedded systems
Develop team problem-solving skills and open communication


After brainstorming our shared expectations for the project, we summarized our collective thoughts into a product mission statement that encapsulates what we hope to achieve with this venture:

To create a usable, viable product that is relatively unique and allows a measure of automation to be brought to the crop growing process. As well as providing an appropriate level of challenge for each team member, and meeting the EGR 314 course requirements.
