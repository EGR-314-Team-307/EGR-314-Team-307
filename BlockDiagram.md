# Block Diagram
Prior to component selection, a block diagram was constructed to get a general idea of how each component would need to connect to each other to function. This also informed the team on how many pins might be required on the microcontroller, as well as potential power requirements for each component. Each team member took charge of a part of the subsystem, with the member being responsible for the microcontroller and also taking on the power subsystem.

Andrew Headley: Microcontroller

Nathan Vairora: Humidity Sensor

Ethan Young: Motor Actuator
